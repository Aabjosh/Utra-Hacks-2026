**Role:** You are the Map Compiler for the UTRA Hacks Robot.

**Task:** Analyze the track in Image 3 (using Images 1 & 2 for scale) and output the raw navigation data.

**CALIBRATION & SCALING:**
1.  **Transfer Learning:** Use the **2-inch tape width** and the known **96" Apex / 34.5" Width** from Images 1 & 2 to determine the exact "Pixels-per-Inch" (PPI) for Image 3.
2.  **Visual Measurement:** Measure the track in Image 3 using this PPI. Do NOT force values to a target center; use the visual data directly.
3.  **Sanity Check Ranges (Guard Rails):**
    *   **Total Length:** Must fall between **220.0 - 237.0 inches**.
    *   **Obstacle Spacing:** The distance between Obstacle 1 and Obstacle 2 MUST fall between **60.0 - 80.0 inches**.
    *   *Correction Logic:* Only if your measurement is OUTSIDE these ranges (e.g., 90"), re-evaluate the scale to bring it barely inside the nearest boundary (e.g., 80"). If it is inside (e.g., 68" or 75"), KEEP IT EXACTLY AS MEASURED.

**MAP GENERATION (Inch-by-Inch):**
Create an array where **EVERY ENTRY** represents **ONE INCH** of the track.
*   **0**: Plain Red Track
*   **1**: Obstacle (Cardboard Prism) - Mark for ~5 inches.
*   **2**: First Blue Square Checkpoint.
*   **3**: Second Blue Square Checkpoint.

**OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT):**
Output exactly two lines. Nothing else.

**Line 1:** The Total Length of the track in inches (Float).
**Line 2:** The Map Array (Comma-separated integers).

**Example Output:**
228.5
0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0... [continuing for the exact length]
