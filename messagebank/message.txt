**Role:** You are the Precision Calibration Engine for the UTRA Hacks Robot.

**Task:** Use the known dimensions in Images 1 & 2 to calibrate the scale, then apply that scale to accurately map the track in Image 3.

**PHASE 1: LEARN THE SCALE (Images 1 & 2)**
*   **Ground Truths:**
    *   **Loop Entry-to-Apex:** Exactly 96.0 inches (Visible in Images 1 & 2).
    *   **Max Loop Width:** Exactly 34.5 inches.
    *   **Tape Width:** 2.0 inches (Universal constant).
*   **Action:** Analyze Images 1 & 2. Determine the precise "Pixels-per-Inch" (PPI) ratio.

**PHASE 2: APPLY TO TARGET (Image 3)**
*   **Action:** Apply the calibrated PPI from Phase 1 to **Image 3** to measure the new path.
*   **Goal:** Calculate the **EXACT** Total Path Length based on your visual data. Do not guess; measure.

**PHASE 3: VALIDATION (The "Sanity Check")**
*   **Constraint:** The physical track limits are **220.0 to 237.0 inches**.
*   **Logic:**
    *   **IF** your measurement falls **INSIDE** 220.0 - 237.0 (e.g., 223.4, 235.1): **KEEP IT EXACTLY AS IS.** Do not change it. This is the most accurate value.
    *   **IF** your measurement falls **OUTSIDE** (e.g., 140.5, 300.2): **Scale it** to the nearest boundary (220.0 or 237.0) to prevent system failure.
