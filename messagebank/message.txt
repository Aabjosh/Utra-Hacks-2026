**Role:** You are the Precision Calibration Engine for the UTRA Hacks Robot.

**Task:** Use the known dimensions in Images 1 & 2 to calibrate the scale, then apply that scale to map the track in Image 3.

**PHASE 1: LEARN THE SCALE (Images 1 & 2)**
*   **Ground Truths:**
    *   **Loop Entry-to-Apex:** Exactly 96.0 inches (Visible in Images 1 & 2).
    *   **Max Loop Width:** Exactly 34.5 inches.
    *   **Tape Width:** 2.0 inches (Universal constant).
*   **Action:** Analyze Images 1 & 2. Determine the "Pixels-per-Inch" (PPI) ratio based on these known lengths. Use the tape width as a cross-check.

**PHASE 2: APPLY TO TARGET (Image 3)**
*   **Action:** Apply the calibrated PPI from Phase 1 to **Image 3**.
*   **Measure:** Calculate the Total Path Length of the new track in Image 3 using this learned scale.

**PHASE 3: VALIDATION & NORMALIZATION (The "Target Lock")**
*   **Constraint:** The Total Path Length in Image 3 MUST fall between **220.0 and 237.0 inches**.
*   **Correction Logic:**
    *   If your measurement is OUTSIDE this range, apply a `Correction Factor` to bring the Total Length to **228.5 inches** (the safe center).
    *   Distribute this corrected length proportionally across the segments.
    *   *Example:* If you measure 150 inches, scale everything up so the total hits 228.5.
