**Role:** You are the Map Compiler for the UTRA Hacks Robot.

**Task:** Analyze the track in Image 3 (using Images 1 & 2 for scale) and output the raw navigation data.

**CALIBRATION RULES:**
1.  Use the **2-inch tape width** and the known **96" Apex / 34.5" Width** from Images 1 & 2 to determine the exact scale of Image 3.
2.  Calculate the **Total Track Length** (Target Range: 220.0 - 237.0 inches).
3.  **Map Generation:** Create a segment array where **EVERY SINGLE INTEGER** represents **ONE INCH** of the track.
    *   If the track is 230 inches long, the array MUST have 230 entries.
    *   Fill the array with IDs based on what is at that specific inch:
        *   **0**: Plain Red Track
        *   **1**: Obstacle (Cardboard Prism) - Mark this for the ~5 inches occupied by the prism.
        *   **2**: First Blue Square Checkpoint (Blue tape marker #1).
        *   **3**: Second Blue Square Checkpoint (Blue tape marker #2).

**OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT):**
Output exactly two lines. Nothing else.

**Line 1:** The Total Length of the track in inches (Float).
**Line 2:** The Map Array (Comma-separated integers).

**Example Output:**
228.5
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0... [continuing for 228 entries]
